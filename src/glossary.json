These classes are designed specifically around learning and cleaning the choreography for that specific routine.  As an example, a Ballet Choreo class will use the skills and technique learned in a Ballet Tech class to learn and clean choreography to be entered as a routine in competition."

        "definition": "Usually used to describe a type of class, a Tech class focuses on learning and perfecting techniques that apply to that style of dance. There may be choreography taught in a Tech class, but it is used to improve the dancer's skills and abilities rather than full Choreo to be entered in a competition.  As an example, a Ballet Tech class will focus on technique and skills specific to Ballet, but will not result in a full, choreographed routine used in competition."
